# Paintings-Dataset
I have created the painting dataset to try and learn webscraping with help of python and BeautifulSoup
I have used http://en.most-famous-paintings.com as source of dataset to collect images and details.

I have attached my python jupyter notebook file which ihave used for scraping data.
You can find a file "details.csv" with three columns:
  1. SN : Seriel No of the painting in the source.
  2. Name : The name of the artist (or) creator of the painting
  3. Painting : Name of painting.
  
 Images are in the images.rar
    each image is saved in a format : "Seriel NO - Artist name - Painting name"
    
I hope you find it useful !!
Thankyou.
